# **Machine Learning README: All My Public Projects**  

Welcome to my machine learning repository! This is where I showcase my growing collection of machine learning projects.  

Here’s what I’ve got for you so far:

## **1. CheeseOrNotCheese: Firm or Not Firm**  

This project predicts whether a cheese is **firm** or **not firm** based on its characteristics like moisture content, milk type, and fat level. 

Significant Packages Used:

`pandas` and `numpy`: Data loading and manipulation.
`scikit-learn`: Used for preprocessing, building pipelines, Decision Tree modeling, and hyperparameter tuning.
`altair`: Data visualization to analyze features like milk type, fat level, and cheese firmness.

## **2. YelpClassifier Predict Yelp Ratings**

Description: This project focuses on classifying Yelp reviews as either 1-star (negative) or 5-star (positive). 
It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess review text and a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the star rating based on customer sentiments.

Significant Packages Used:

`pandas` and `numpy`: Data loading and cleaning.
`nltk`: Text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
`scikit-learn`: TF-IDF vectorization, Naive Bayes classification, and model evaluation.
`matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Visualization of text features and model performance metrics.
